           Survival trips, by their nature, involve an element of risk. You are in a very different, remote environment, and taking part in difficult and strenuous activities. This is why you came surely! There are risks to such ventures, though the chances of being bitten by a snake or attacked by a jaguar are almost nil. The more likely risks are the likes of heat injuries and self-inflicted cuts.

            We employ a detailed system of safety measures from the ability to give first aid from a well-stocked medical kit on the spot, and evacuation systems involving every potential method from stretchers to boats to aircraft. We are, however in remote places and they do not have all the search and rescue capability of the developed world.
            We also employ the latest technology in communications, using satellite and HF radio communications, satellite tracking systems as well as a variety of means of identifying ourselves to rescue aircraft and teams.

            When taking part in risky activities, the latest safety kit, from ropes, harnesses, lifejackets and helmets are used. All this equipment is inspected regularly and is fully up to date with the latest safety guidelines dictated by the UK lead body organization for such activities. The UK is the national standards system we follow.

            Bushmasters conducts detailed risk assessments on all activities undertaken. The concept behind a risk assessment is to identify potential risks, grade the likelihood and severity of an incident, and identify the actions we therefore take to mitigate that risk and also what procedures we put in place in case of such an incident. These are constantly being reviewed. Additionally it may be that certain activities are high risk, so we need to put in place safety procedures to lower their risk score. If not possible, we may not be able to conduct that activity. That is why we do not do underwater knife fighting. We do underwater spear gun shooting though!
